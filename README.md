Deep Learning Model for University Students GPA Prediction with Placement Assistance.

In higher educational institutes, many students need to war tough to finish one-of-a-kind
publications for the reason that there's no devoted guide supplied to college students who
want unique interest in the registered publications.Predicting the performance of students
is one of the most critical topics required for studying contexts including colleges and
universities, as it allows to layout a hit mechanisms that improve tutorial outcomes and
save you dropouts amongst various items.
Current methods of college students’ Grade Point Average (GPA) prediction rely on the
use of tabular facts as input. Intuitively, inclusive of historical GPA facts can help to
enhance the performance of a GPA prediction version. In this look at, we gift a dual-enter
deep studying version this is capable of simultaneously manner time-series and tabular
records for predicting student GPA. Our proposed model achieved the satisfactory
ordinary performance among all tested fashions with 0.4142 MSE (Mean Squared Error)
and 0.418 MAE (Mean Absolute Error) for GPA with a four.0 scale. It additionally has the
wonderful R2-rating of 0.4879, which approach it explains the proper distribution of
college students’ GPA better than different models.
The purpose of any new technology is to make people life easier this application can be
esaily implimented under various situations. As an extenction of this project we can
implement concept of advance learning models such as MLP classifier,ISTM,RNN
models and creating an application for the model to make it advanced.
After the prediction the gpa of the students we can use that prediction for assistance using
placements like the particular student with specific skills can be estimated to be placed in
any company with the specific requirements.
